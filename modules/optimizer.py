    Previously this always asked for and evaluated ONE candidate at a time,

    had zero effect on wall-clock time. This now genuinely batches
    `num_workers` candidates per round and evaluates them concurrently via a
    thread pool (nevergrad's ask-many/tell-many pattern is explicitly
    designed for this). With num_workers=1 (the default) this is exactly
    the old serial behaviour — nothing changes unless you raise it.

    Note: the Kalman filter's per-timestep loop is Python-level, not a
    single vectorized numpy call, so GIL contention limits how much thread
    parallelism can help — the numpy matrix multiplies inside each step do
    release the GIL, so there's a real, if likely partial (not N×), speedup
    from raising num_workers. It is, at minimum, no longer a no-op.

    sequential optimizer calls.
